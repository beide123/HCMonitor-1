# HCMonitor (High Concurrent Monitor, The project has been moved to https://toscode.gitee.com/acs-dcn/HCMonitor for maintenance and update.)
### Introduction

HCMonitor is a monitor system for high concurrent network services, which is developed on user-level and estimates response latency from requests input to responses output, called server-side latency. 
The measurement is transparent for network services by switch mirroring traffic, and finally displays the real-time results including latency CDF distribution, average delay, concurrency and throughput. 

### Release Notes

**V 1.0**

+ Fully monitoring
+ Accurate measurement of per-request latency
+ Transparent for network services
+ DPDK-based

### Architecture
 
 ![HCMonitor_architecture](HCMonitor_architecture.png)

### Prerequisites
* libdpdk (Intel's DPDK package*, DPDK-19.08 best) 
* libnuma
* libconfig
* mysql
* mysqlclient
* python2.7      

### Included directories

```bash
./    
|__HCMonitor/	HCMonitor src files              
```

### Installation

#### DPDK intsall

```bash
$ wget https://fast.dpdk.org/rel/dpdk-19.08.2.tar.xz
$ tar -xvf dpdk-19.08.2.tar.xz 
$ cd dpdk-19.08.2/usertools/
$ ./dpdk-setup.sh
     - Press [39] x86_64-native-linux-gcc to compile the package
     - Press [43] Insert IGB UIO module to install the driver
     - Press [47] Setup hugepage mappings for NUMA systems to setup hugepages
     - Press [49] Bind Ethernet/Baseband/Crypto device to IGB UIO module
     - Press [60] Exit Script to quit the tool
We use dpdk/ submodule as our DPDK driver. FYI, you can pass a different dpdk source directory as command line argument.
```
**Introduction to Compatible NIC**
Only those devices will work with DPDK drivers that are listed on this page: http://dpdk.org/doc/nics. Please make sure that your NIC is compatible before moving on to the next step.

#### Setup HCMonitor 

#### Compile
```bash
$ cd <path to HCMonitor>
$ vim Makefile
  # Add two configurations at the beginning as below
  RTE_SDK= <path to dpdk>
  RTE_TARGET=x86_64-native-linuxapp-gcc
$ make
```
The executable application monitor will be generated under build/

#### Run

configure the switch port (H) connected to HCMonitor to mirror the inbound and outbound traffic from port S1 to Sn, which represents the ports connected to servers.

![HCMonitor_Test_Method](HCMonitor_test.png)

Configure the file setting.cfg according to own needs, for example:
```bash
$ vim setting.cfg
	enableHTTP = 1      //Test the normal HTTP traffic
	label_offset   = 6    // label location offset in payload bytes(count from 0)
	request_label  = [0,2]  //request label for judging if a packet is a request
	response_label = [1,3]  //response label for judging if a packet is a response
```

For start parameter description, please execute
```bash
$ build/monitor -h 
```
Start Examples(12 cores, 1 NIC port)
```bash
$ ./build/monitor -c fff -n3 -- -p1
```
**Introduction to Results Output**
Open cdf.txt to check the latency CDF distribution, average delay and concurrency periodicity.

### Frequently asked questions

1. How can I quit the application?
Use ^C to gracefully shutdown the application. Or you can kill process with “pkill” command in Linux.


### Roadmap

+ Extend to multi-queue receiving packets.
+ Support more protocols and performance metrics.
+ carry out more detailed service detection such as packet loss and abnormal disconnection.
